The Challenge 
Using the following dataset, please implement a model or algorithm that can classify news articles of (at least) the type "earn" covered in the dataset. Coding Challenge Data 
 
The Rules 
No time limit is enforced for this project. As such, you are welcome to spend as little or much time on it as you wish, though we want to be respectful of your time spent. Please let us know however much time you take on the task! 
 
Use whatever libraries/frameworks/tools you wish, though Python is the required language. Develop your work however you wish (including on a local machine), but the end result should include all relevant files hosted on Google Drive, and a Google CoLab notebook that can run your code, load your model*, and allow for testing with additional data. After November 22, you are welcome to publicly make available your work here on hosting sites like GitHub for your own portfolio, but posting anything publicly before that time will result in automatic disqualification from the hiring process. 
External libraries, tutorials, codebases, etc. are fine to use, but provide your sources, including tutorials, boilerplate code from frameworks, links to StackOverflow, and so on. Unattributed external code will be considered automatic disqualification from the hiring process. 
 
As part of the evaluation process, data formatted similarly to the data you will use for this project will be run against your model. Please provide a method of running a file like the others provided against your model, which will score it. 
 
How To Submit Your Challenge (before 11/22/21) 
In order to apply for the apprenticeship, you must submit links to a completed Google CoLab notebook, a Google Drive folder with any relevant data, and a Google Slides presentation. Please submit those as part of your application process. Completed projects’ data/slides/Colab notebooks/etc. should be made available to view by anyone with the link. You must include links to the completed project as part of your application. If you encounter any issues with permissions, please email a link (and allow access) to dbishop@interos.ai.
 
Required as part of your Google CoLab: 
A notebook that can be run from top to bottom* (see below for a note on CoLab’s limitations) which will load a pre-saved model (or other approach to the problem) and allow predictions with it for new data, including a similarly-formatted file to those used in training, as well as raw text 
Comments (or Markdown, or other) explaining any functions, your process, etc. 
Comments attributing code adapted from external sources 
 
Required as part of your Slides presentation 
Your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process – How did you check the data for this project? How are your data split for training versus testing, or other ways to segment it? 
Your modeling process – how did you make something that can automatically categorize news articles? Do you predict a single label from a given input, or multiple? Binary decisions, or scored from 0-1, or even something else entirely? Why? 
How you review your results – given your model, how do you then make new predictions with it, and how do you check it for accuracy beyond simple scoring metrics?  
Additional data – given a working model, how would you incorporate more data, or make changes to the training data you already have? 
A bit about you, 
Any other necessary technical details of your project, 
Anything else of note. 
 
* Due to RAM/GPU limitations, your code, if developed locally, may not be able to run on Google CoLab. If this is the case, please provide detailed documentation as to its performance and how to locally reproduce the results (such as a requirements.txt, readme, pipenv/poetry lock file, etc.)
